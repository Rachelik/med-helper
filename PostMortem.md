# Post Mortem

###### Approach and Process
*What in my process and approach to this project would I do differently next time?*
- See more examples on how things work before doing. To prevent the mess.

*What in my process and approach to this project went well that I would repeat next time?*
- Split the project into small task.
- Explore libraries for forms.

###### Code and Code Design
*What in my code and program design in the project would I do differently next time?*
- The sorting by time (and form input)
- More organize manner (still learning). Like med.frequency can just be saved as a variable before sorting.
- useState
- CSS
- The boolean is by button but each button works separately. Not so fluid.
- Think of how to make the index section better.

*What in my code and program design in the project went well? Is there anything I would do the same next time?*
- The components.
- Reuse the sort function.

For each, please include code examples.
Code snippet up to 20 lines.
Code design documents or architecture drawings / diagrams.

###### SEI-22 Unit 4 Post Mortem
*What habits did I use during SEI that helped me, that I will take on to my future coding projects?*
- Understand the basic.
- Read more.
- Some commenting help me think too.

*What habits did I have during SEI I can improve on that I will try to change on future projects?*
- More comments.
- Assignments.

*How is the overall level of the course overall? (instruction, course materials, etc.)*
- The basic and assignments helped.
- However, a bit blur on the overall. As in when dealing with full stack, not sure what I did was right.
